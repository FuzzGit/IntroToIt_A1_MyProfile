					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hi, I’m Fazil.
<p></p>
I was born in Hyderabad, India, and moved to Melbourne, Australia, at the tender age of seven with my parents and two siblings. Fast forward thirty-three years and I still call Melbourne home where I reside with my beautiful wife and two young boys. 
Although questionable, I can speak in both Hindi and Urdu, but my preferred language is English.
I’m a bit of a foodie! Apart from the joys I get from eating food (and the calories – then again who’s counting?), I love the joys of cooking food and the satisfaction I get from people enjoying my food. I especially enjoy cooking dishes from my birth town of Hyderabad, home of the world’s best Biryani.  
</p>
<p>Fun facts about me: </p>
<ul>
<li>My nickname is Fuzz. Not sure how I got this but had it ever since I can remember. 
<li>Although born in India, the home of spicy food, I’m probably the only Indian who cannot handle the heat.
<li>One of my favourite hobbies is DJing. Any major functions held by family and friends’; I’m usually called upon to DJ. I’d like to think that they love my DJ style but It’s more likely that I’m their cheapest option, which is free. 
</ul>
<img src="djfuzz.jpg"width="200"height="180" />
<ul>
<li>I love travelling. Here is a list of my travel adventures so far:
	<ul>
	<li>India – Most parts (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa, Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan, Chennai) 
	<li>Australia – All except NT. My favourite getaway location is anywhere along The Great Ocean Road in Victoria.
	<li>Malaysia – KL and Langkawi 
	<li>Singapore
	<li>Japan
	<li>Hawaii
	<li>Vietnam x 2
	<li>Thailand
	<li>Cambodia
	<li>New Zealand – North and South Island
	<li>Bali
	<li>Fiji
<p></p>
</ul>
One of my most memorable travel experience was going to the Tiger Park in Thailand and casually taking a tiger for a walk. Although, I believe the tiger was taking me for a walk!  
</ul><br>
<img src="tigerwalk.jpg"width="200"height="180" />

Once the world is back to its Covid normal stage, next travel destination would be Turkey, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT started at a very early age, in the early 90’s, when I received my first DOS based computer. I recall spending countless hours playing games that required typing in commands in order for the player to move. I was just amazed by the technology and fascinated with the fact that I’m in control of this machine, that relied on me for it to operate. This interest further progressed through my high school years during the late 90s as I was introduced to dialup internet, connecting me to the world wide web. I was amazed at the fact that I no longer needed to refer to the hard copies of the encyclopedia for my school projects as I now had the entire copy in my PC. Then came the innovation of MP3 files and WinAmp. This was the best thing that could happen to someone who loves music but couldn’t afford music.<br>  
<br>In hindsight, I regret never pursuing a career in IT. Although, I did do some IT studies approx. 20 years ago but decided to follow a different career path. I recall being competent at C++, SQL, VBA, MS Office, and bits of Java. However, with a 20-year gap, I no longer have these skills.<br> 

<br>My only work experience in IT was in early 2000. While studying IT, I worked part-time for a small business that sold flat screen computer monitors and refurbished PCs. My job was to identify and replace any hardware issues (mostly Hard drives and CD drives) and install MS Windows and MS Office. Unfortunately, this job didn’t last long as the owner discontinued selling PC’s, but it was great experience for me.<br> 

<br>At current, what interests me most about IT is its ability to, put simply ‘make life easy’. I love the idea of automation; this is one of the reasons why I’ve decided to go back to studying IT.<br> 

<br>At my current and past workplace, I’ve managed to implement some great ideas using basic applications such as MS Excel, MS Word, MS Teams and PowerApps. I believe I have a real knack for coming up with solutions and innovative/creative ideas with the focus on automation where possible. I can usually envision very quickly exactly how I want my idea/s to be created, implemented, its capabilities and the algorithm. The only thing I lack are the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the ideas. As an example, instead of storing data on MS Excel where multiple user input is required, I’d want a web-based form that allows multiuser input and capabilities to export this data into MS Excel.<br> 

<br>I decided to study my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT as the course and the subjects best suits the skills and knowledge, I require to achieve the goals as outlined above. In addition, as RMIT have this course online, it’s given me the ability to manage my studies whilst working a fulltime job, with two young children and wife who works part-time.<br> 

<br>During this course, I’m hoping to learn how to program in Phyton, machine learning, manage an IT project and be able to build my own website and mobile app.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Senior Front End Developer</h2>
					<img src="Idealjob.jpg"/>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This position is for a senior front end developer for a utilities company. What appeals to me about this position is that the company is seeking a developer who is innovative and is driven by exceptional user experience. The idea of having the responsibility of developing an application that will be the front face of the company, with your name on it, and knowing what you have created has provided the best user experience, how could this not be appealing?<br> 
 
					<br>Furthermore, certain details in the position description indicate that the company has great work culture and a meaningful goal (e.g., cleaner, chance to be heard, diversity, support, flexible) which is 
					</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>My current skills are:<br>
<ul>
	
<li>Leadership and managerial skills
<li>Stakeholder management
<li>Workforce management
<li>Analytics
<li>Yellow Belt certificate
<li>Innovative
<li>MS Excel and Word
<li>Strong people skills
<li>Team player
</ul>
</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The key skills and qualification required for this position is an experienced web developer, who has strong JavaScript skills, is innovative and has worked in an agile environment.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>As this is a senior position that requires experience. I would aim to gain experience in a basic front-end developer role prior to completing this degree (if I have the knowledge to do so). If I’m unable to find a basic role prior to completion of this degree, I would commence working on my own personal front-end projects as there are plenty of ideas that I would like to implement. This way I have some experience that would put in a better position when I do graduate from this course.<br> 

<br>Further, If the specifics skills required (e.g ES6, React, Angular) are not covered in this degree, I would look at completing additional certificates outside of this course as required for the position.

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers-Briggs – Personality Test</h2>
					<p>The results from the Myers-Briggs test suggest that I have a Campaigner style personality.<br> 

<br>The results certainly resonate closely to my actual personality, that I’m striving to find ways to do things better, be creative, inspiring, and enjoy the freedom of exploring innovative ideas. The results shows that I have a balanced personality, particularly in the workplace. Not that it’s entirely a bad thing, but it’s helped me realise that I need to possibly work more on my thinking rather than my feelings when it comes to decision making.<br> 

<br>The results indicate that my personality has all the right attributes to work in a team. It shows that I can work with anyone, and that I’m charismatic and am able to excel at dealing with unexpected challenges.<br>

<br>The results give me confidence that I can work with any personalities, therefore forming a team would be of no real concern with regards to who is in the team. I’d aim to use my personality traits to help encourage the team members that require it.

					<h2>Education Planner – Learning Style Test</h2>
					<p>The results from the learning style test accurately show that I lean more towards a visual and tactile learning style.<br> 

<br>The results wouldn’t influence my behaviour in a team as I’m confident that most people are more visual and hands-on learners with less auditory, just like myself. In the team, I would aim to influence team member to follow this approach if we’re not doing so already, explaining the befits. </p>

					<h2>Creativity Test – Test My Creativity</h2>
					<p>The results from the creativity test accurately show that I do have a creative mind that is greater than an average person. These results provide reassurance that I’m on the right track in terms of creativity.<br> 

<br>The results will certainly help influence my behaviour in a team as it gives me the confidence to be creative and share with the team.<br> 

<br>When forming a team, not entirely important but would be good to have member that share the same style of thinking.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>uDecide is intended to be an all-in-one website and mobile app that is essentially a smart TV guide for all your subscribed streaming services, with the added benefit of ratings from popular rating sites such as IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. In addition, uDecide will have the ability to recommend or decide your next movie or TV show for viewing.</p>  
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>According to Business Insider, it is estimated that a staggering 80% of all Australian households hold subscription to at least one streaming service. It is further estimated that on average, each household have subscription to 2.3 TV and movie streaming service (Healey, B 2021).<br>

<br>Like many, with the large amounts of steaming content available at our fingertips, just the thought of deciding what to watch next can be quite daunting, not to mention time-consuming.<br>

<br>The motivation to build uDecide came about one evening when my wife and I had our routine argument about who’s turn it was to decide what we were watching. After time wasted going back and forth with “you decide,” “no, you decide”, we ended up settling for a movie that we had already seen. This was the last thing we wanted after a long day and especially after finally putting our toddler to sleep. Life would be far less complicated if our first world problem of deciding what to watch was decided for us, hence the idea to build uDecide.
</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Instead of spending valuable time flickering through 100s and 1000s of streaming content, potentially taking just as much time as it takes for you to watch that one episode or movie that you finally settle for, uDecide does all the hard work for you using its AI and machine leaning capabilities to decide for you. For uDecide to provide a recommendation, it will need access to the user’s streaming service account. This way, uDecide can link with the streaming service and automatically keep track of what’s been watched. This is where the learning begins for uDecide, to provide and forecast the next best watch.<br> 

<br>One of the biggest challenges I found when it comes to movies or tv show selection is ensuring my section meets the criteria of a minimum IMDB review rating score of 7 or above. Unfortunately, the world’s most popular streaming service, Netflix does not display the contents review ratings from any of the major rating websites such as IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. This is where uDecide will note primarily the available IMDB rating next to the movie or TV show selected, and Rotten Tomatoes rating if available as a secondary.<br>
  
<br>Key features of uDecide will be as follows:<br>
<ul>

<li>Ability to link your Subscribed streaming service profile with the uDecide application.  
<li>Mobile app and Website
<li>Through machine learning, the ability to recommend a movie or show to watch. 
<li>A library of all content available in Australia for the most popular streaming service providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Stan, Paramount Plus, BINGE and Foxtel Now (this is to be expanded to include other counties and streaming service providers in future releases). 
<li>IMDB review ratings of all streaming content  
<li>Personalised Watch List
<li>Top 100 list of most popular movies or TV shows based on genre. 
<li>Filter options that display only the contents you want to view.  Filters to be included:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Streaming service
	<li>Movies and TV shows
	<li>Classification (CTC, G, PG, M, MA 15+, R18+)
	<li>Genre (including ‘based on true story’)
	<li>Actor via search function
	<li>IMDB ratings score (0 – 10)
	<li>Awards winning
	</ul>
<li>Search function

</ul>
</p>

<p>In addition to the above listed features, uDecide will have a special feature to provide the best recommendation for your child’s liking. We know that the major streaming service providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video automatically come with a ‘Kids’ user profile. The issue is that the contents included in this profile can range anywhere from toddlers to early teenagers. This can be particularly challenging when it comes to choosing the right content suited for your child. As we know, every child is different. If we take for example pre-schoolers, some may only like viewing contents with only nursery rhymes, whereas some may prefer contents that are suited for early school aged kids. As such, uDecide will have the capability to have a ‘Kids’ profile, again using machine learning technology to create a watch list and recommendation specifically catered for your child’s need.  
</p>


				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The uDecide website will require a combination of programming script languages and codes such as JavaScript, HTML, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and SQL for database management.<br> 

<br>In order for the mobile app to be available on both iOS and Android, the software required would be IDE to allow Hybrid programming language such as C#.<br> 

<br>In addition, Python will be required to program machine learning capabilities and GitHub to manage the source codes and version control.<br> 

<br>With regards to hardware requirements, as uDecide will be handling large amounts of data, the recommend hardware would be Linux based server run on dedicated Intel based hardware such as Intel® Xeon® E-2286G processor with 256GB RAM, Motherboard with 2 cooler fan and 1 cabinet fan, 4 network ports (each 1 Gbps per port) and 12 USB 3.0 ports (Ankesh Anand 2020).</p> 

				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required for the successful implementation of uDecide are as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Project management – To create a business plan for the project and ensure execution and delivery of the project.
<li>Web developer skills to build the website
<li>App developer skills to build the mobile app 
<li>Design skills to ensure it’s the best-looking app and website
<li>Data skills as the core of the uDecide is in its data
<li>Machine learning – This skill is required to allow star feature of uDecide to work. That is, the ability to predict and recommend streaming content based on historical usage. 
<li>Hardware skills to setup the hardware required to ensure seamless running of uDecide
<li>Testing skills to ensure the application is running as intended prior to rollout
<li>DevOps skills to ensure continuous delivery of uDecide.
</ul>
<br>uDecide is very much feasible as its essentially a database of information that is already available from IMDB and Australian streaming services. It’s just a matter of storing this data into an app and website and having an experienced programmer to create a prediction, based on the data available. The biggest hurdle will be linking the streaming service profile to the uDecide application.</p>  
	</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The intention is to rollout uDecide in a phased approach. This ensures the most efficient implementation and provides the ability to evaluate the any progress of the application and make amendments before moving to the next phase.<br> 
<br><b>Phase 1</b><br>
<ul> 
<li>Basic application that has a library of major Australian streaming contents with IMDB rating score. 
<li>Movies and TV shows recommendation determined by manual filter and sort by user.
</ul>
<br><b>Phase 2</b>
<ul>
	<li>Link subscribed streaming service profile with the uDecide application
	<li>Fully automated recommendation to user
</ul>
<br><b>Phase 3</b>
<ul>
	<li>Expand to include other counties and streaming service providers  
</ul>
<br> 
The successful rollout of uDecide will see users saving time, money (remember time is money!) and less chance of arguing over what to watch on TV.<br> 
<br>Just imagine, before you even switch on the TV, you’ve already planned out what you’ll be watching. There’s no need for multiple watch list on multiple steaming sites, it’s all there in one easy app. 
uDecide - not just a TV guide!</p>
